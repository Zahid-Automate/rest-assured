# rest-assured
<h3>‚ùìWhat is this Repository about? </h3>

This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - Rest-assured. I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests in an efficient way. Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository with all example code from writing basic tests to running end to end API automation tests.

<h3>üíº What does this repo contain? </h3>
This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.<br>
Hamcrest Matchers are used for assertions.<br>
TestNG Listeners are used to capture the events in logs.<br>
Log4j is used to capture logs.<br>
Lombok has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.<br>
FAKE Rest APIs on Reqres.in has been used for testing.<br>
End to End scenarios have been added for the restful booker APIs.<br>
